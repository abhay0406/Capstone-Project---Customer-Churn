# Capstone-Project---Customer-Churn
An E Commerce company or DTH (you can choose either of these two domains) provider is  facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has become a challenge to retain the  existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model  through which they can do churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the  potential churners. In this company, account churn is a major thing because 1 account can have  multiple customers. hence by losing one account the company might be losing more than one  customer. You have been assigned to develop a churn prediction model for this company and provide  business recommendations on the campaign. Your campaign suggestion should be unique and be very clear on the campaign offer because  your recommendation will go through the revenue assurance team. If they find that you are  giving a lot of free (or subsidized) stuff thereby making a loss to the company; they are not going  to approve your recommendation.  Hence be very careful while providing campaign recommendation
